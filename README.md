# Welcome!

Here are is a brief description of the 2 reports I prepared for my grad course at Université de Montréal.

The first one deals with WSN and energy-aware L3 protocols, wile the second one exposes Android Security, in particular I focused on detection strategies.

# Energy Aware Routing methods for Precision Agriculture

This repository contains my presentation, in french, of the current L3 energy aware routing techniques for precision agriculture. There is also the subsequent report.
They are both provided in the PDF format.

The audience was my classmates from the graduate course: INF 6055 - Protocoles de communications (Université de Montréal).
The scope of the project was to present a synthesis of a specific subject.

*Presentation: WSN_Presentation.pdf*

*Article: WSN_Report.pdf*

I start by presenting the Precision Agriculture, it's current challenges and the introduction. Then, I present the subject.

## Overview (translated from french):

### I) Wireless sensor networks


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) A sensor
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Wireless Sensor Networks
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C) The importance of simulation 
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Communication standards

### II) The energy Conservation techniques


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A) The various mechanisms involved
  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B) Energy-aware routing
  
  
### III) A concrete example (not in the article)
### IV) Futures directions
### V) Conclusion
