# -Energy-aware-WSN-Routing
This repository contains my presentation, in french, of the current L3 energy aware routing techniques for precision agriculture. There is also the subsequent report.
They are both provided in the PDF format.

The audience was my classmates from the graduate course: INF 6055 - Protocoles de communications (Université de Montréal).
The scope of the project was to present a synthesis of a specific subject.
